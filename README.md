The ARTW is a blockchain based Art verification and art trading platform. We are building an Art ecosystem which will enable all the stakeholders of the industry – Artists, collectors, art enthusiasts, art exhibitors & galleries and institutional buyers to buy/sell genuine, verified artwork from our trading platform.
We utilize most secured blockchain technology for cortication and define authenticity of any artwork, anytime, anywhere in the world. Our platform enables Galleries/Artists to upload their artworks (both digital and non-digital) and art lovers to visit and explore any artists’ artwork digitally, through Virtual and Augmented Reality techniques. Moreover, ART galleries can conduct e-auctions and display featured paintings on our platform. Users can invest in artwork without worrying about the authenticity of the artwork and get the NFTs instantly in their wallets. 
To simply things further, we will be launching a native token called ARTW, an BEP20 standard based token, which will be legally tradable on existing crypto exchanges, partnering Art Galleries and Artists. ARTW can be considered a utility token within its community, since it also acts as a means of exchange in the art marketplace.

Text and image should be aligned
We have created a unique ART industry Ecosystem on blockchain, where all stakeholders like Collectors, Enthusiasts, Artists, Galleries, Auction houses and Art Owners can register and start using our platform for their own benefits.
Our platform opens a gamut of possibilities and deals very effectively with the biggest problems of the industry – verifying the authenticity of ARTwork and a seamless low cost platform for Artists to showcase their Artworks.
Our aim is to revolutionize the global fine art market (USD 50.4 billion in 2020), as per ART Basel & UBS 2021 report. As a business model we will be active in key global ART markets – USA, Europe, China and upcoming potential markets, India and South Africa. Our focus will be on selling Digital ART and NFTs while keeping the platform easy and ready to use for traditional artworks as well. Empanelling Galeries, Artists and Artworks on our platform will be the key to build an ecosystem and paintings from Ivy League painters. Building trust between buyer and sellers by eradicating fake paintings from the industry is our ultimate aim, by using the world’s most secure and transparent blockchain technology.
